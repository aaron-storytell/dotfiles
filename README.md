* `.alias` to alias commands and shortcuts
* `.exports` to modify existing or export new environment variables
* `setup.sh` to install or update the setup which installs some stuff and then runs the following:
  * `brew-install.sh` to install brew
  * `setup-node.sh` to setup NodeJS
  * `setup-nvim.sh` to setup neovim/neovide
